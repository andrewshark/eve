bugs & misc:
* handle SIGWINCH to detect terminal size changes
* rework keyboard input to support different terminals
allow customizable key mappings and reading partial keys
* minimal screen update for colored text
screen update code must not differ between platforms
* support unicode input and newline differences
support unicode input, console etc
decode/encode text from file to runtime enconding, translate newlines
rewrite eve code to support unicode
support utf-8 on windows and utf-16 on linux?
handle invalid unicode sequences?
* misc
review the rest of unit tests
default params in test comments
replace rehash with ensureCapacity?

basic features:
* search/replace
* selection with highlighting and alt+arrows
* unindent with backspace
* go to line
* terminal window resizing
* block indent, comment
* paragraph back/forward

advanced features:
* multiple file support
* regex search/replace
* search/replace in files
* parse build output for errors
* syntax highlighting
basic highlighting based on file suffix for a few common languages
keywords, numbers, strings, comments
* word completion
parse a set of directories for words
cache results in a file
offer completion after second letter
offer recently used, located nearby first
complete on tab or punctuation

foundation features:
* convert any object to string
* type safe string formatting
* date and time
* locales (formatting, string compare/search/case conversion)
* encoding conversion
* threads/atomics/async
* function objects (function/bind)
* type traits
* containers
initializer_list support
conversion between containers (array to list etc)
create element in place
move node pointers in map/set when rehashing to avoid allocation
* strings
split/join, tokenizer
conversion to binary/hex
simple parsing a la scanf
simple regular expressions
