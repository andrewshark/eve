bugs & misc:
* check git line ending settings
* handle SIGWINCH to detect terminal size changes
* screen update code shouldn't differ between platforms
bring back the fast update code for windows?
* many keys don't work in Linux, macOS, xterm
rework keyboard input to support different terminals
allow customizable key mappings and reading partial keys
* support unicode input and newline differences
rewrite eve code to support unicode
support utf-8 on windows and utf-16 on linux?
handle invalid unicode sequences?
* decode/encode text from file to runtime enconding, translate newlines
trim trailing whitespace
must not be allowed to maniulate string data via pointer?
check for zero chars in text file?
acquire with capacity?
blob class for array of value types?
simple string too?
have to scan utf-8 file every time for utf-16 detection
make sure app code doens't do low level stuff and relies on foundation
console writing to screen is totally broken

cache results in a file
offer completion after second letter
offer recently used, located nearby first
complete on tab or punctuation

foundation features:
* convert any object to string
* type safe string formatting

* containers
initializer_list support
conversion between containers (array to list etc)
create element in place
move node pointers instead of nodes when rehashing to avoid allocation
