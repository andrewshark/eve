bugs & misc:
* gcc optimized version crashes
* indent should consider previous non-empty line
* pasting blocks of code into terminal results in ever increasing indent
* some keys don't work in Linux, macOS, xterm
alt+[ and alt+O don't work
rework keyboard input to support different terminals
allow reading partial keys
same or different keys on different platforms?

editor:
* selection with arrows and highlighting
* handle terminal window resizing (SIGWINCH)
* block indent, comment
* paragraph back/forward
* quickly switch between documents
* find/replace in all documents
* regex find/replace
* parse build output for errors
* undo/redo
* command history
* syntax highlighting
highlighting based on file suffix for a few common languages
keywords, numbers, strings, comments
* autocomplete
parse a set of directories for words
cache results in a file
offer completions after first letter
offer recently used, located nearby first
complete on tab or punctuation

foundation:
* convert any object to string
* type safe string formatting
* date and time
* improved Unicode support
locales (formatting, string compare/search/case conversion)
consider supporting both UTF encodings on any platform
encoding conversion
handle invalid Unicode sequences
* threads/atomics/async
* function objects (function/bind)
* type traits
* containers
initializer_list support
conversion between containers (array to list etc)
create element in place
move node pointers instead of nodes when rehashing to avoid allocation
* strings
split/join, tokenizer
conversion to binary/hex
simple parsing a la scanf
simple regular expressions
* foundation improvements
prohibit write access to container data via pointer?
acquire with capacity?
blob class for array of value types?
simple string too?
make sure app code doens't do low level stuff and relies on foundation
StringWithEncoding - string with encoding information
support for zero chars in string?
replace smart pointers with smart references
rename the types to make int 64 bit?
string constructor that accepts ascii strings
log memory allocations
move assignment is called when string is assigned an r-value freeing string storage
unicode char literals don't work on solaris/aix
