bugs & misc:
* consider changing naming convention
* handle SIGWINCH to detect terminal size changes
* many keys don't work in Linux, macOS, xterm
rework keyboard input to support different terminals
allow customizable key mappings and reading partial keys
* support unicode input and newline differences
rewrite eve code to support unicode
support utf-8 on windows and utf-16 on linux?
research utf-8 support in windows and macos
handle invalid unicode sequences?
manipulating Text with String functions must not be allowed
string find char is possibly incorrect, shouldn't use string search
* foundation improvements
prohibit write access to container data via pointer?
acquire with capacity?
blob class for array of value types?
simple string too?
make sure app code doens't do low level stuff and relies on foundation
StringWithEncoding - string with encoding information
support for zero chars in string?
replace smart pointers with smart references
rename the types to make int 64 bit?
string constructor that accepts ascii strings

basic features:
* search/replace

cache results in a file
offer completion after second letter
offer recently used, located nearby first
complete on tab or punctuation

foundation features:
* convert any object to string
* type safe string formatting
* date and time
* locales (formatting, string compare/search/case conversion)
* encoding conversion
* threads/atomics/async
* function objects (function/bind)
* type traits
* containers
initializer_list support
conversion between containers (array to list etc)
create element in place
move node pointers instead of nodes when rehashing to avoid allocation
* strings
split/join, tokenizer
conversion to binary/hex
simple parsing a la scanf
simple regular expressions
