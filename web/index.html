<h1>ev text editor</h1>

<p>ev is a simple cross-platform text editor written in C++ with minimal dependencies. The executable is just a few hundred kilobytes in size. The editor works in a text console or terminal on five platforms - Windows, macOS, Linux, Solaris and AIX. GUI support is planned for the next major version.</p>

<p>If you think that ev stands for "eradicate vi" then you are mistaken :-) I have great respsect for that venerable text editor. I personally used vim as my main development environment for several years and I love it passionately!</p>

<h3>Keys</h3>

<p>Keyboard commands are designed to work on as many terminals as possible without the need to change ev or terminal settings. To achieve that ev provides alternatives for key combinations that may not be supported by a specific terminal.</p>

<p><table>
<tr><td style="width: 120px">arrows</td><td>move cursor</td></tr>
<tr><td>alt+left/right</td><td>word (identifier) left/right (also ctrl+left/right, ctrl+b/w)</td></tr>

<tr><td>home/end</td><td>start/end of line (also ctrl+h/e)</td></tr>
<tr><td>alt+home/end</td><td>start/end of file (also ctrl+home/end, alt+h/e)</td></tr>
<tr><td>pgup/pgdn</td><td>page up/down (also ctrl+p/n)</td></tr>
<tr><td>alt+pgup/pgdn</td><td>20 lines up/down (also ctrl+pgup/pgdn, alt+p/n)</td></tr>
<tr><td>tab</td><td>next autocomplete suggestion, indent line/selection</td></tr>
<tr><td>shift+tab</td><td>previous autocomplete suggestion, unindent line/selection</td></tr>
<tr><td>delete</td><td>delete character at cursor position</td></tr>
<tr><td>backspace</td><td>delete character to the left of cursor position</td></tr>

<tr><td>alt+backspace</td><td>delete word to the left of cursor position (also ctrl+backspace, ctrl+])</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p><table>

<p><table>
<tr><td style="width: 120px">alt+,</td><td>go to previous document</td></tr>
<tr><td>alt+.</td><td>go to next document</td></tr>
<tr><td>alt+digit</td><td>go to nth document</td></tr>
<tr><td>alt+b/w</td><td>characters (space separated) left/right</td></tr>
<tr><td>alt+d</td><td>delete word (space separated) at cursor position</td></tr>
<tr><td>alt+]</td><td>delete word (space separated) to the left of cursor position</td></tr>

<p><table>
<tr><td style="width: 120px">F2</td><td>toggle command line</td></tr>
<tr><td>F5</td><td>build with make</td></tr>
<tr><td>F8</td><td>save document</td></tr>
<tr><td>F9</td><td>save all documents</td></tr>
<tr><td>F10</td><td>save all documents and quit</td></tr>
<tr><td>ESC</td><td>quit editor</td></tr>
</table></p>

<p>building with make: by default ev executes 'make' on UNIX systems and 'nmake.exe' on Windows. This can be overriden by setting MAKE_CMD environment variable.</p>

<p>macOS note: By default Mac Terminal app sends weird codes for alt+key combinations. They are currently unsupported by ev. You can fix the issue by turning on 'Use Option as Meta key' on the Keyboard tab in the terminal profile settings. To make ev more useful you can add a few key mappings there:</p>

<p>Home - \033[1~<br>
Option+Home - \033\033[1~<br>
End - \033[4~<br>
Option+End - \033\033[4~<br>
PgUp - \033[5~<br>
PgDn - \033[6~<br>
Option+Delete - \033\033[3~</p>

<h3>Commands</h3>

<p>Command line is accessible at the bottom of the screen by pressing F2 key. Optional parameters are in square brackets.</p>

<p>s - save current document</p>

<p>sa - save all documents</p>

<p>c - close current document</p>

<p>q - quit editor</p>

<p>qs - save all documents and quit</p>

<p>g number - go to line number</p>

<p>f[i] search-string - find string<br>
i - ignore case</p>

<p>r[ida] search-string replace-string - replace string<br>
i - ignore case<br>
d - replace all matches in current document<br>
a - replace all matches in all documents<br>
use any character as string separator instead of space</p>

<p>n filename - new file</p>

<p>o filename - open file</p>

<h3>Autocomplete</h3>

<p>Autocomplete works by scanning for all identifiers in open documents and it lets you complete words as you type by pressing Tab key. The list of autocomplete suggestions can be refreshed by saving documents or by pressing alt+'. Completetion works best with at least two starting letters. When you press Tab the current suggestion is inserted into the text but the cursor remains after the last letter typed. If there're letters to the right of the cursor, the inserted word overwrites them.</p>

<p>If you are satisfied with the suggestion, you can type the next character following the word such as space or punctuation. The cursor jumps to the end of the word and that character is inserted, minimizing the number of keystokes. If you move the cursor instead, the 'jump to end' feature is disabled and the next character will be inserted where the cursor is.</p>

<p>If you are not satisfied with the suggestion, you can press Tab or Shift+Tab to go to the previous/next suggestion or you can type one or more letters until autocomplete gives you the expected result without pressing Tab too many times. You can also press Backspace to erase previous letter and automatically suggest a new word based on the shorter prefix.</p>

<h3>Syntax highlighting</h3>

<p>Languages for which syntax highlighting is currently supported: C, C++, UNIX shell scripts. ev by default assumes bright screen background and uses darker colors for syntax highlighting to improve contrast. To override this you can use --dark command line option.</p>
