<h1>eve text editor</h1>

<p>eve is a simple cross-platform text editor written in C++ with minimal dependencies. The executable is just a few hundred kilobytes in size. The editor works in a text console or terminal on five platforms - Windows, macOS, Linux, Solaris and AIX. GUI support is planned for the next major version.</p>

<p>eve stands for "excellent visual editor", "extremely versatile editor" or "eradicate vi and emacs" whichever you prefer :-)</p>

<h3>Keys</h3>

<p>Keyboard commands are designed to work on as many terminals as possible without the need to change eve or terminal settings. To achieve that eve provides alternatives for key combinations that may not be supported by particular a terminal.</p>

<p><table>
<tr><td style="width: 120px">F2</td><td>toggle command line</td></tr>

</table></p>

<p>building with make: by default eve executes 'make' on UNIX systems and 'nmake.exe' on Windows. This can be overriden by setting MAKE_CMD environment variable.</p>

<p>macOS note: By default Mac Terminal app sends weird codes for alt+key combinations. They are currently unsupported by eve. You can fix the issue by turning on 'Use Option as Meta key' on the Keyboard tab in the terminal profile settings. To make eve more useful you can add a few key mappings there:</p>

<p>Home - \033[1~<br>
Option+Home - \033\033[1~<br>
End - \033[4~<br>
Option+End - \033\033[4~<br>
PgUp - \033[5~<br>
PgDn - \033[6~<br>
Option+Delete - \033\033[3~</p>

<h3>Commands</h3>

<p>Command line is accessible at the bottom of the screen by pressing F2 key. Optional parameters are in square brackets.</p>

<p>g number - go to line number</p>

<p>f[i] search-string - find string<br>
i - ignore case</p>

<p>r[ida] search-string replace-string - replace string<br>
i - ignore case<br>
d - replace all matches in current document<br>
a - replace all matches in all documents<br>
use any character as string separator instead of space</p>

<h3>Autocomplete</h3>

<p>Autocomplete works by scanning for all identifiers in open documents and it lets you complete words as you type by pressing Tab key. The list of autocomplete suggestions can be refreshed by saving documents or by pressing alt+'. Completetion works best with at least two starting letters. When you press Tab the current suggestion is inserted into the text but the cursor remains after the last letter typed. If there're letters to the right of the cursor, the inserted word overwrites them.</p>

<p>If you are satisfied with the suggestion, you can type the next character following the word such as space or punctuation. The cursor jumps to the end of the word and that character is inserted, minimizing the number of keystokes. If you move the cursor instead, the 'jump to end' feature is disabled and the next character will be inserted where the cursor is.</p>

<p>If you are not satisfied with the suggestion, you can press Tab or Shift+Tab to go to the previous/next suggestion or you can type one or more letters until autocomplete gives you the expected result without pressing Tab too many times. You can also press Backspace to erase previous letter and automatically suggest a new word based on the shorter prefix.</p>
