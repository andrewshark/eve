bugs & misc:
* keyboard input improvements
some keys don't work in xterm (pgup/pgdn, cursor keys)
copying text from screen doesn't have newlines
support unicode input
* using size vs zero terminator for text
* paste lines at any column
* extra indent when adding new line
* set selection to empty after every text editing operation

porting to windows and c++:
* change array to use capacity
* for containers with capacity
round allocation to next greater power of 2
to take advantage of memory allocator implementation
* add asserts for invalid params to all other functions
* write unit tests for all classes
* findNoCase, appendFormat
* better string concat
* don't know how much memory to allocate for utf-8
using char_t for single char is incorrect
pos, len must be in chars not in bytes
* screen update slow and flickering on windows
* how to handle new lines on windows?
decode/encode text from file to runtime enconding
* real tab doesn't work anymore
* use realloc where appropriate

basic features:
* search/replace
* selection with highlighting and alt+arrows
* unindent with backspace
* go to line
* terminal window resizing
* block indent, comment
* paragraph back/forward

advanced features:
* multiple file support
* regex search/replace
* search/replace in files
* parse build output for errors
* syntax highlighting
basic highlighting based on file suffix for a few common languages
keywords, numbers, strings, comments
* word completion
parse a set of directories for words
cache results in a file
offer completion after second letter
