bugs:
* screen gets cleared when executing run command on Linux
* run build command before run?
* stay in block mode after paste for easy indenting

cairo:
* check memory management for graphics
* font creation during text drawing may be slow
* floating point color
* keyboard and mouse input
* vertical text alignment
* ellipsis on windows
* class name comments

editor likely:
* graphical user interface for linux and macos
* open files over network
support mobile devices and bloomberg environment
* switch between source/header
* quick open files
name autocomplete, wildcards
open recrusively, open file at cursor
* delete to start/end of line
* go to matching brace, next/previous brace
* cycle documents in most recently used order
* copy/delete lines
* change case
* find/replace regex, backwards, match word/case
* undo/redo
* open multiple files in the same instance
* run macro until it reaches specified line
* language specific toggle comment
* display short help message if there're no files
* guess font size based on physical dpi in editor
* don't erase cusror when prev position is not on the screen
* better solution for drawing cursor (overwrite instead of blend)
* high resolution icon
* replace explicit pointers with smart pointers
* blurry text on remote desktop
* run command that doesn't laucnh command prompt

editor misc:
* run release version in profiler, memory/thread checker
* support intel compiler, arm hardware, windows server
* makefile improvements: precompiled headers, foundation library, incremental link
* signed executable and installation package, deb and rpm packages
* alternative domains for website
* text in tables is too small on mobile website, magic page width

input improvements:
ctrl+minus/plus don't work on windows, use WM_KEYUP instead?
test fancy character input like wiwndows mnemonic for russian
many ctrl and alt combinations don't work in Linux console
fallback for function keys (either alt key or command)

syntax highlighting improvements:
* support for other languages
* improved handling of highlighting corner cases
* document type detection with shebang
* document type override

autocomplete improvements:
* complete longest
* give nearby words or words from same document higher priority
* autocomplete for file names
* scan all documents in directories

performance improvements:
* turn off indexing and syntax highlighting for large files
* group small insert/delete changes and apply together
* redraw as few characters as possible instead of enitre screen

editor maybe:
* customizable key mappings
* execute shell commands
* readonly mode
* run last command, command history
* file browser
* parse build output for errors, display inside the editor
* find/replace in files
* selection with mouse/arrows and highlighting
* line wrapping
* move to prev/next paragraph/function
* preserve console output when exiting
* fallbacks for function keys
* version for mobile devices
* performance improvements
open large files in native encoding
use memory mapping and on demand/background loading
store text as a list of lines/blocks
syntax highlighting and autocomplete

foundation:
* international support
locales (formatting, string compare/search/case conversion)
encoding conversion
handle invalid Unicode sequences
* containers
initializer_list support
conversion between containers (array to list etc)
create element in place
move node pointers instead of nodes when rehashing to avoid allocation
benchmark/improve hash function
append for Array? merge Buffer and Array?
* strings
use USC-2 for all strings?
charAt/charForward as one call
string constructor that accepts utf-8 strings
store short strings in place
split/join, tokenizer
conversion to binary/hex
simple parsing a la scanf
simple regular expressions
type safe string formatting
* log memory allocations
* convert any object to string
* memory mapped I/O, file system access
* date and time
* threads/atomics/async
* function objects (function/bind)
* type traits
* optional, variant, weak pointer

foundation misc:
* don't use asserts in low level OS specific code
